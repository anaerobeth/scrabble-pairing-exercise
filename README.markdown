## Scrabble-Web

This application includes a set of skipped tests in both
`test/integration` and `test/models`. Use them as a guide
to demonstrate your understanding of Rails applications.

1. Clone the repo and run `bundle`
2. Run the tests with `bundle exec rake test`
3. Observe that there's one test failing
4. Implement code to satisfy the test
5. Pick a next skipped test, unskip it, and return to (2)

Notice that there is a `Guardfile` if you like to use Guard.
